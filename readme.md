# Algernon Cornelius

Algernon Cornelius is a hip hop producer and musician from Manchester, UK.
For my final project at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/), where I studied from July - August 2019, I decided to create a single-page web application using React for Algernon Cornelius to promote his music, music videos and tourdates.

It also includes a special feature which made up the bulk of this project, a browser-based music musical instrument, inspired by the kind of [samplers](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)>) that Algernon Cornelius uses to make his music. This feature was made using the tone.js API.

## Technology used

HTML / JSX, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, ReactDOM, React Hooks, Webpack, Tone.js API

## Features

-   Users can make their own beats, using an interactive sampler made using a combination of the tone.js API and custom JavaScript code. Users can trigger a music sample by clicking on one of 16 pads, or by using their keyboard as a controller. They can play a combination of these samples to make music, either freestyle, or by using a metronome to help them to keep time. There are also a number of effects that can be applied, either individually, or in combination, to change the samples and create completely new sounds.

-   Albums can selected and played using a custom-made carousel which rotates in either the left or right direction.

-   By clicking on a single button, a modal opens or closes, which on open, revealing a list of tour dates.

-   The layout was created using CSS grid; as a workaround to bypass the inability to set borders in the grid, a single vector image was set to repeat on every grid item.

## Features planned for future implementation

-   Mobile responsiveness, including the ability for users to tap the sampler pads on mobile devices.

-   Implement a backend database to allow the artist to add tourdates using forms which can only be visible upon login.

-   Use socket.io to allow to users to play music at the same time.

-   Allow users to upload and delete their own samples.

-   Allow users to save the tracks that they have created.
